    <p>Innovative and engaging, program manager with extensive experience leading PMO functions across technical
        projects and product portfolios. With experience establishing program management functions, I am adept at
        supervising change management, vendor and consultant relationships, negotiating contracts, and supervising
        deliverables. In my current role, I spearhead the strategic direction and continuous improvement of corporate
        planning and execution processes to ensure visibility, alignment, predictability, and overall portfolio
        governance. I am passionate about helping people accomplish their jobs at a high level. Guiding executive teams,
        I am skilled at coordinating across business units to ensure excellence in delivery management, support, and
        governance of digital products. I build top-performing teams and monitor vendor performance, routinely
        implementing process improvements to optimize productivity.</p>
